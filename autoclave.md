# Autoclave use protocol

1. Before autoclaving, make sure:
   * Everything being autoclaved has autoclave tape on it (the tape indicates if items have been properly sterilized)
   * Any screw-on lids are loosely screwed onto any bottles going into the autoclave (if screwed down all the way, bottles could explode during the autoclaving process)
2. Load items to autoclave into autoclave bin
   * Liquid and dry items are autoclaved seperately
   * 3 L of liquids max
   * Don't stack liquids, but you can stack dry items
3. Place the autoclave bin into the autoclave
4. Shut autoclave door all the way
5. Select the proper protocol from the menu
   * Press "Select cycle", scroll to correct protocol, press "enter" to view protocol
   * Liquids:
      * 500 mL: P13 liq LIQUIDS1 (15 min exposure time)
      * 1-1.5 L: P15 liq LIQUIDS1 (20 min exposure time)
      * 2-3 L: P14 liq LIQUIDS1 (30 min exposure time)
   * Dry: P8 grav GRAVITY1 (30 min exposure time)
6. Press "Start" to start cycle
7. When cycle is finished, autoclave will ring
8. If autoclaving liquids, take items out of autoclave
   * Wear protective gloves and be careful&mdash;items will be very hot
   * If autoclaving media with agar for pouring plates, immediately put media in 55Â°C water bath
   * For other liquids, leave out at room temperature
9. If autoclaving dry items, crack open the autoclave door about a couple inches and let items dry for a couple hours or overnight, then take out of autoclave
   * Items will still be hot after drying, so wear protective gloves when handling the items

   * If autoclaving agar, dump liquids into bucket by the sink in the lab and then rinse out the bin with hot water
