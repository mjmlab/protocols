# Estimating cfu using the multi-channel pipette#

## Equipment needed:
- 20 - 200 µl multi-channel pipette
- sterile plastic trough (can also use an unused Petri dish)
- filter tips for p20 and p200
- sterile 96 well plastic plate/s
- Plates of the appropriate media

## Dry plates under the hood:
- A wetter plate means it will take longer for the spots to soak in (and plates should only be incubated at the appropriate temperature once all spots have dried).

## Set up wells for dilution:
- Estimate the volume of diluent you will need: 0.18 ml x well number (e.g. if using the whole plate, 0.18 ml x 96 = 17.3 ml).
      For *E. coli* and *K. pneumoniae*, use 1% NaCl, minimal salts, or cold LB, and for *V. fischeri*, use 70% Instant Ocean.
- Pour diluent into a sterile plastic trough.
- Set the multichannel pipette to 180 and dispense 180 µl into each well.
      (The wells can take take up to 300 µl liquid.)

## Serially dilute sample(s):
IMPORTANT: when going from a more dense well (lower dilution) to a less dense well (higher dilution), always change pipette tips, since liquid or bacteria can stick to the sides. If you must use the same tip, rinse by pipetting up and down several times in sterile water or diluent.
- Place 20 µl of sample into the first well (the 10^-1 dilution) and pipette up and down to disperse.
      Up to 8 10^-1 wells can be filled at a time for use with the multi-channel.
- Use the multi-channel pipette to transfer 20 µl from the 10^-1 wells to the 10^-2 wells.
- When moving a suspension from one well to the other, mix by pipetting at least 10 times. This can be done before removing from the initial well or after adding to the next well.
- Discard tips and repeat to the desired dilution.

## Spot dilutions:
- Spot either 10 µl or 20 µl of each dilution in duplicate on dried plates. If using the multi-channel pipette, the minimum volume is 20 µl. These spots will be very close to each other and may need to be staggered between dilutions to not run together. If using a p20, spot 10 µl of each dilution (they will take less time to dry and fit better on a plate).
- If you are spotting from highest dilution (least dense) to lowest dilution (most dense), you can keep the same pipette tips.
- Wait until spots dry completely. This will be faster if the lid is propped open.
- Incubate plates at the appropriate temperature until colonies are visible, but do not grow so long that they run together.

## Calculate cfu:
- Count cfu in spots that contain between 25 - 125 colonies. Average the two duplicates together.
Use cfu = (colony number) x (1000/vol spotted) x (inverse dilution).
     e.g. 40 colonies in a 10 µl spot of a 10^-4 dilution: 40 x (1000/10) x (1/10-4) = 40 x 100 x 10000 = 4 x 107
            25 colonies in a 20 µl spot of a 10^-5 dilution: 25 x (1000/20) x (1/10-5) = 25 x 50 x 100000 = 1.25 x 108
