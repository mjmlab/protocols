Use the transposon-specific Round 2 primer for DNA sequencing.

### Primer notes

MJM-477 (pMarVF1): Sequence is in the direction opposite that of the erm cassette (i.e., plus direction sequence indicates that the erm cassette is inserted into the chromosome in the minus orientation).

MJM-716 (pJNW684): Sequence is in the direction opposite that of the kan cassette (i.e., plus direction sequence indicates that the kan cassette is inserted into the chromosome in the minus orientation).


## DNA Preparation

Prepare genomic DNA (gDNA) from each candidate using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Handbook, using the Gram negative  pretreatment. Elute in 100 μl H<sub>2</sub>O, determine DNA concentration by Nanodrop, and normalize the concentration to 28.6 ng/μl.


## Semi-arbitrarily-primed PCR, Round 1

Recipe is for 50 μl reactions. Prepare master mix of a minimum of 10 reactions to avoid pipetting tiny volumes.

## Column purification

Purify each sample with the Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. Elute in 50 μl H2O.

*Note that even for successful samples a band is typically not observed by gel electrophoresis.*


## Sequencing

Check concentration by Nanodrop. Yield should be 5-20 ng/ul; concentrate with a DNA Speedvac if concentration <5 ng/μl, and submit for DNA sequencing.

## Analysis

The round 2 primers anneal within the transposon facing outwards, so the first part of the sequence read will be specific to the transpson. For pMarVF1 (primer MJM-477), this includes the first 145 bp; for pJNW684 (primer MJM-716), this will be the first 109 bp. The sequence you will want to BLAST occurs after CCAACCTGTTA, where the TA is the site of insertion into the chromosome. If the BLAST results give chromosomal coordinates, be sure it matches to the first base after this sequence and not to another part of the read, since that could indicate a PCR artefact. Note the location of the insertion and if the homology is increasing or decreasing.

### To orient the transposon, follow this table:
| Gene direction on chromosome         | Read is increasing | Read is decreasing |
| ----------------                     | -------------:   | ------------:   |
| Plus strand (transcribed right)       | anti-directional | co-directional  |
| Minus strand (transcribed left)      | co-directional   | anti-directional|

## Scaling Up

For large numbers of samples, consider the following changes to scale up the analysis:
- Use colonies or overnight culture diluted (1:100) in water, instead of gDNA prep.
- Do 10 μl PCR reactions.
- Use EXOSAP-IT in place of each column purification. This inactivates the previous round primers, so removing them is no longer necessary. Add 4 μl EXOSAP-IT to the Round 1 products and incubate. Then dilute the sample to 100 μl and use 1 μl of that sample in the Round 2 Arb reaction. Add 4 μl EXOSAP-IT to the Round 2 product and incubate. Then add sequencing primer and submit.

### EXOSAP-IT incubation
    - 1 cycle:
        - 37 °C, 15 m
        - 80 °C, 15 m
    - Hold at 12 °C (and move to 4 °C fridge)
