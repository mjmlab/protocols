# Conjugation  

**Day 0**  

1. Plate strains for mating on agar, grow overnight.
  - Donor – *E. coli* on selective LB.  Grow 37°C.
  - Helper – *E. coli* CC118 λpir / pEVS104 [MJM534] on LB-Kan50.  Grow 37°C.
  - Recipient - typically *V. fischeri* on LBS.  Grow 25-28°C.  

**Day 1**  

1. Grow overnight liquid cultures of the strains with antibiotics if necessary.

**Day 2**  

1. Combine 100 μl of each *E. coli* culture only in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube (see controls below).
1. Pellet cells by centrifugation (1 min at 8,000 x g).
1. Add 100 μl of each *V. fischeri* culture to the *E. coli* pellet.
1. Pellet cells by centrifugation (1 min at 8,000 x g); resuspend in 10 μl fresh LBS.
1. Spot this onto a fresh, thick LBS plate.
1. Incubate for ~16 h at 25-28°C.

**Day 3**  

1. Scrape the mating mix off the plate and suspend in 750 μl of LBS. In the case of *V. fischeri*, spot should be yellowish.
1. Plate on selective media and incubate at room temperature (or cooler, e.g., 15°C).
  - This cooler temp enriches for Vibrio over the *E. coli* donor.
  - For "frequent" events like introduction of a stable plasmid, plate dilutions and/or streak purify from the spot.
1. Colonies should appear in 1-2 days at room temperature, or 3-4 days at 15°C.  Streak-purify transconjugants.

A generic tri-parental mating includes an *E. coli* strain with pEVS104 as the conjugal helper plasmid, a second *E. coli* strain with an *oriT*-containing plasmid to be mobilized, and a recipient Vibrio. For quadraparental mating (ex. with mini-Tn7) use 200 µl of the Vibrio recipient.  

Controls: Same as conjugation tube but excluding one of the constituent strains (no donor, no recipient, and no helper controls).

Plate freshness: Fresh LBS plates seem to help a lot.  If possible, use them the same day you pour them; just make sure they’re not "sloppy wet." If you want to compare mating efficiencies of different constructs, be careful to use similar plates or multiple spots on the same plate.

## Triparental Conjugation into Klebsiella

This is a protocol describing the triparental conjugation of Tn7 transposon and Tn7 transposase plasmids into a deletion strain of KPPR1. The complementation of VK055_1398 into its deletion strain is used as an example.

**Day 0**  

1. Make overnight cultures of each strain:
   - Transposon Plasmid (pAD13, MJM5668): Grown in LB-Kan50-DAP liquid media at 37C, shaking
   - Transposase Plasmid (pJMP1039, MJM4078): Grown in LB-Carb100-DAP liquid media at 37C, shaking
   - Deletion Strain (∆1398, MJM): Grown in LB at 37C, shaking
   - Positive control (Any previously complemented strain made)


**Day 1: Conjugation**  
**Important: Do all steps in the BSC**

1. Add 500 uL of each strain to a tube, mix well with a pipette
   * At this point, make multiple *negative controls* using just the deletion strain, just the transposase plasmid, just the transposon plasmid, etc.
   * Also make a *positive control* by using the previously complemented strain
2. For all samples:
   * centrifuge for 3 min at max speed
   * Resuspend pellet in 10 uL of LB-DAP
   * Plate 10 uL spot onto LB-DAP plate
   * Wait 10 min for spots to dry
   * Parafilm plates and put into 30C incubator
     * If putting in core room, make sure that you put all plates into box for Klebsiella plates

**Day 2: Plate Klebsiella**  
**Important: Do all steps in the BSC**

1. Take spots out of the incubator
2. For each spot, do the following:
   * Pick up spot using sterile cotton swab soaked in 1x PBS
   * Swirl swab well (about 30 sec) in 1 mL of 1x PBS in 2 mL centrifuge tube
   * Dilute to 10^-2 and 10^-4 using 1x PBS
   * Plate onto LB-Kan50 plate *with no DAP*
   * Parafilm plate
3. Put plates into 30C incubator overnight

**Day 3-5: Kick out plasmids**  

1. Streak 4-8 colonies from yesterday onto 2 different plates:
   * LB-Kan50: Shows that Kleb has the Tn7 site inserted
   * LB-Carb100: If candidates grow on this plate, that means that plasmids haven't been kicked out of the Klebsiella. Restreak until candidate doesn't grow on this plate

Usually it takes 1-2 days for the plasmids to be kicked out

2. If candidates aren't growing on the LB-Carb100 plate, make overnight cultures in LB-Kan50 and grow overnight at 37C shaking

**Day 6: PCR Screen**  

* Use AD_103 + 104 as the primers
  * Sequences are in the lab database as well as in Pep Charusanti's paper
* For template DNA, use a 1:100 dilution of overnight culture
* After screen, run Q5 PCR and PCR purify the product
* Send the purified PCR product to Plasmidsuarus for linear amplicon sequencing
