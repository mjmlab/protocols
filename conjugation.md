# Conjugation (Triparental Mating)

**Day 0**
1.	Plate strains for mating on agar, grow overnight.
Donor – *E. coli* on selective LB.  Grow 37°C.
Helper – *E. coli* CC118 λpir / pEVS104 [MJM534] on LB-Kan50.  Grow 37°C.
Recipient - typically *V. fischeri* on LBS.  Grow 25-28°C.

**Day 1**
1.	Grow overnight liquid cultures of the strains with antibiotics if necessary.

**Day 2**
1.	Combine 100 μl of each *E. coli* culture only in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube (see controls below).
1.	Pellet cells by centrifugation (1 min at 8,000 x g).
1.	Add 100 μl of each *V. fischeri* culture to the *E. coli* pellet.
1.	Pellet cells by centrifugation (1 min at 8,000 x g); resuspend in 10 μl fresh LBS.
1.	Spot this onto a fresh, thick LBS plate.
1.	Incubate for ~16 h at 25-28°C.

**Day 3**
1.	Scrape the mating mix off the plate and suspend in 750 μl of LBS.
	 - In the case of *V. fischeri*, spot should be yellowish.
1.	Plate on selective media and incubate at room temperature (or cooler, e.g., 15°C).
   - This cooler temp enriches for Vibrio over the *E. coli* donor
   - For "frequent" events like introduction of a stable plasmid, plate dilutions and/or streak purify from the spot.
1.	Colonies should appear in 1-2 days at room temperature, or 3-4 days at 15°C.  Streak-purify transconjugants.

A generic tri-parental mating includes an *E. coli* strain with pEVS104 as the conjugal helper plasmid, a second *E. coli* strain with an *oriT*-containing plasmid to be mobilized, and a recipient Vibrio. For quadraparental mating (ex. with mini-Tn7) use 200 µl of the Vibrio recipient.

Controls: Same as conjugation tube but excluding one of the constituent strains (no donor, no recipient, and no helper controls).

Plate freshness: Fresh LBS plates seem to help a lot.  If possible, use them the same day you pour them; just make sure they’re not "sloppy wet." If you want to compare mating efficiencies of different constructs, be careful to use similar plates or multiple spots on the same plate.
