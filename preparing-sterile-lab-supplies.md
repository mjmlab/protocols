# Preparing Sterile Lab Supplies

## General information
* Wear gloves when preparing supplies for sterilization
* Autoclave tape should be dog-eared to aid in removal of tape
* When closing containers with aluminum foil:
  * Foil should be double layered (take a big piece and fold it in half)
  * Make sure foil is large enough to generously cover container (foil goes about 1/3 of the way down)
* [Autoclave protocol](autoclave.md)

## Microfuge tubes

* There are several different sized microfuge tubes: 0.2, 0.5, 1.7, and 2 mL
* Put tubes in tripours (large for 1.7 and 2 mL tubes, small for 0.2 and 0.5 mL tubes)
* Cover top of tripour with aluminum foil
* Label top of foil using Sharpie with size of tube
* Place autoclave tape on seam between foil and container
* Autoclave

## Pipette tips

* There are 3 sizes of pipette tips we refill boxes of for autoclaving: 10/20 uL, 200 uL, and 1200 uL
* Pipette tip refills come in wafers that can just be inserted into empty tip boxes
* When boxes are filled and ready to autoclave, put a piece of autoclave tape on seam between the lid and bottom of the box
* Any tip box waste (empty wafers, plastic package the refill wafers come in) can be put in designated cardboard box for recycling
* Autoclave

## Culture tubes

* Put red culture tube caps on glass 16 mm culture tubes
* Put capped culture tubes in square metal cage for autoclaving
* Place piece of autoclave tape over top of tubes (don't need to individually tape the tubes)
* Autoclave

## Glass beads

* Using the little "scoop" in the clean beads container, scoop 5 glass beads into racked 13 mm glass tubes
* Cap the tubes
* Place piece of autoclave tape over top of tubes (don't need to individually tape the tubes)
* Autoclave

## Long sticks

* Generally, lab members will use a tube of long sticks, then recap and autoclave tape them when they are finished
* If new tubes need to be made:
  * Fill mm glass tubes about 1/2 to 2/3 full of long sticks
  * Cap the tubes
  * Place piece of autoclave tape on seam between cap and tube
  * Put tubes in square metal cage for autoclaving
  * Autoclave

## Toothpicks

* There are two types of toothpicks we use: flat and round
* Generally, lab members will use a set of toothpicks, then foil, label, and autoclave tape them when they are finished
* If new sets of toothpicks need to be made:
  * Fill a small plastic beaker with toothpicks (leave some room for ease of use)
  * Flat picks need to go into the beaker big end down
  * Place aluminum foil over beaker
  * Label top of foil using Sharpie with "F" for flat or "R" for round toothpicks
  * Place autoclave tape on seam between foil and container
  * Autoclave

## Glycerol tube stocks

* There are 3 types of glycerol tube stocks we use: red-, yellow-, and white-capped tubes
* Red-capped tubes get filled with 600 uL of 50% glycerol, yellow- and white-capped tubes get filled with 300 uL of 50% glycerol
  * [50% glycerol recipe](media.md#glycerol-50-vv)
* Place tubes in Wheaton rack
* Unscrew tube caps but leave caps on the tubes
* Add glycerol to tubes
* Loosely screw caps down (not all the way)
* Place autoclave tape on top of rack of tubes (don't need to individually tape tubes)
* Autoclave
* After autoclaving is finished, let tubes cool and then screw down caps all the way
