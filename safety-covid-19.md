# Mandel Lab Safety Plan for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19

Updated 2020-06-05

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is presenting all of us with new challenges. The goals of this plan are to ensure the health of lab members, promote health in the broader community, prepare for experimental disruption, and ensure that research animals are treated humanely. As much as it is frustrating to have work delayed or deferred, COVID-19 is a serious disease. It is imperative that we protect ourselves and protect the greater community.

Today's update reflects the new phase in which the lab is fully open to the extent possible that allows for social distancing. Please discuss with me at any point if you feel like you are not sufficiently protected, or if you require any additional accommodations.

## Take the following steps

1. **Only visit the laboratory for work that cannot be conducted remotely.** Conduct any work at home that can be done from home, including data and computational analyses, writing, and reading.

1. **You must be individually approved to return to the lab.** If you are approved for return (postdocs and grad students), I have sent you instructions on completing the required training, and details on building rules. Take these rules seriously, including one-way traffic in core facilities and maximum of 1 person per elevator car. At this point, undergraduates are not permitted in the laboratory for any reason.

1. **Practice social distancing.** At any given time, there should be a maximum of four (4) people in the main lab, and a maximum of one (1) person per smaller room (offices, squid facility, microscope rooms). See the Google Doc Denise prepared for coordination.

    - There is a maximum of 1 person per bay and 1 person per pair of facing benches at any given time. This means that all researchers should face the same direction or that there should be at least 1 completely empty bay between researchers facing each other. To facilitate optimal lab use, we have divided the lab into "teams" of three researchers each. Each week by Friday 9:00 am, the team assigned for the subsequent week (Monday-Sunday) should sign up for their preferred times in the lab. After 9:00 am Friday, members of the other team can fill in additional times. We will see how well this works and reevaluate as we move forward. Please be respectful of time needed by your colleagues and work with each other to optimize everyone's success here.

1. **Masks are required.** Cloth or disposable masks are required when in MSB. The lab has disposable masks if needed. Although disposable, these masks can be reused; leave in a paper bag for 3 days. Replace the mask whenever there is evidence that they are failing.

1. **Practice good hygiene and disinfect after use.** Upon entering and before leaving the lab, wash hands with soap for 20 s. Disinfect surfaces near to your work (including desks) with 70% alcohol upon entering and before leaving.

1. **Confocal notes.** The confocal microscope can be used by approved individuals, with a maximum of 1 person in the room at a time. The Huttenlocher Lab will use the same calendar to sign up for their instrument in the room; if that is in use, the confocal cannot be used by another individual. Before and after each use, key surfaces should be disinfected, including the eyepieces. There is no training on the confocal at present.

1. **Drive to lab and park for free.** Avoid public transit, taxis, and ride-shares. Most [surface lots are free](https://transportation.wisc.edu/2020/03/12/operational-response-to-covid-19/).

1. **Pay attention to your physical health.** The CDC has up-to-date information on [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). If you have any of these symptoms remain at home. If your roommates/family have any of these symptoms remain at home. You are not slacking; you are taking responsible steps to limit the spread of a pandemic. Keep in touch if you are ill so that the lab can support you.

1. **Pay attention to your mental health.** This is a scary and unpredictable time. Each of us is different, so I offer just a few suggestions here that may or may not be useful. Feel free to take personal time completely off of work as needed. Convene virtually: Skype "Happy Hours" with friends can be pretty fun and good for all of us. Stay tuned to changes in the news to be aware of the rapidly changing situation; but also recognize when too much news or social media can be damaging for you.

1. **If you require any resources to conduct your work at home, please let Mark know.** For example, computer, monitor, hard drive, scanner, software, etc.

1. **Wash hands regularly with soap and water.** Do the full 20 seconds!

1. **Plan for a future increase in local COVID-19 cases and the possibility of an extended quarantine at home.** Have some beans, rice, fresh and frozen vegetables, fresh and frozen fruit, cereal, etc. so you can remain healthy as the society around us constricts. Try to have at least a month's supply of medication on hand, and talk to your doctor to request a 3-months supply.
